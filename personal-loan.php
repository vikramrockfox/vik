        <h1>What is a Personal Loan?
</h1> 
<p>Personal loans are loans for any purpose that is given without collateral or guarantor. It is a very unique loan where borrower can do whatever they want to do by their choice. In other words, a personal loan can be used by a borrower for his personal needs; It is not like a car loan or a home loan. There is no restriction on the use of such loans, although it should not be used for speculative purposes, tax saving and investments.</p>
<p>A personal loan is a collateral free loan based on the income documents of the individual. Since it is an unsecured loan, the borrowers have a good record of past loans and credit scores.</p>
<p>Personal loan processing requires less documents than any secured loan so is much easier but it always attracts higher interest rate and shorter repayment period.</p>

<p>Any financial institution looks for good documents, credit scores and income because it is strictly a business transaction, and they are not your friends so your good credit score and income documents will help the lender to give you money. Personal loans can be repaid like other loans, which go through the EMI (EMI) process, where you have to pay a fixed amount of money each month.</p>
